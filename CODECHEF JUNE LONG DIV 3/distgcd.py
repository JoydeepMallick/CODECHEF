'''
Chef has two distinct positive integers A and B.

Chef wonders how many distinct values are possible for the expression gcd(A+X,B+X), where X can take any non-negative integer value.

Help Chef find this value.

Here, gcd stands for Greatest Common Divisor.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T â€” the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two distinct space separated integers A and B.
Output Format
For each testcase, output the number of distinct values of the expression gcd(A+X,B+X), where X can take any non-negative integer value.

Explanation
Test case 1: Here gcd(1+X,2+X)=1 no matter what value of X you choose.

Test case 2:

If we take X=0, gcd(12,8)=4.
If we take X=1, gcd(13,9)=1.
If we take X=2, gcd(14,10)=2.
It can be shown that no other value of gcd is possible.

Expalntion

Keen observation is the key

note that count  the number of factors of abs(a-b)

its equal to the number of different gcd possibleðŸ¤¨
